# 🩺 Decentralized Public Health Campaign Registry

Welcome to a transparent, blockchain-based solution for tracking public health campaigns, with a focus on vaccination drives! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity, this project ensures immutable records, verifiable outcomes, and regional accountability for public health initiatives.

## ✨ Features

🔐 **Campaign Registration**: Register public health campaigns with unique identifiers and details.  
📊 **Outcome Tracking**: Record vaccination metrics and campaign outcomes per region.  
✅ **Verification**: Verify campaign authenticity and reported outcomes.  
🌍 **Regional Aggregation**: Track and compare campaign performance across regions.  
🔍 **Transparency**: Provide public access to immutable campaign data.  
🚫 **Tamper-Proof Records**: Prevent unauthorized changes or duplicate registrations.  
📅 **Timestamping**: Log campaign start and end dates immutably.  

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Health Authorities
- Register a campaign with details (e.g., campaign ID, region, vaccine type, target population).  
- Submit outcome data (e.g., doses administered, coverage percentage) to the blockchain.  
- Update campaign status (e.g., active, completed) securely.  

### For Verifiers (Public/Regulators)
- Query campaign details by ID or region to verify authenticity.  
- Validate reported outcomes against immutable records.  
- Compare regional performance for insights into campaign effectiveness.  

### For General Public
- Access transparent, tamper-proof data about ongoing and completed campaigns.  
- Verify vaccination drive progress in specific regions.
